**Assalamu alaiqum** <br>
*I am Muhammad Milon .*<br>
~~I am an intensive level programmer 😁~~ *I am a noob problem solver.* <br>
***This is my personal code library where I have kept the codes I need. Most of the code is my own writing, but I have taken the help of many online resources. I have tried my best to make the codes very readable.  These are not only for competitive programming but also very important for my academics.  I am adding the new algorithm here that I learnt.***
